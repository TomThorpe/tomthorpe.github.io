Privacy Policy

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

Information Collection and Use

The app uses the third party serice Fabric for analytics and error logging. 

Fabric - https://fabric.io/privacy

Log Data

Whenever you use Train Home, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and information (through third party products Fabric) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version and the time and date of your use of the Service, but no personally identifiable information.

When you open Train Home a network request is made for the next train departures from your favourite stations (or pinned journeys), or any stations you request (for example, requesting the next trains from Birmingham International to Euston). No personally identifiable information is included with this request.

The same network request is also made when you pass into the geofence created around a station that has station entering notifications turned on (an opt in feature of the app). Your actual location is never sent.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
